## Film music: 2018 vs. 1998

The corpus contains popular film music from the years 2018 and 1998. More specifically, for each of the two years, 25 of the most commercially successful movies (according to http://boxofficemojo.com/yearly) were included. Working from the top of the list downwards, a soundtrack album was added if the complete album was available on Spotify, until 25 albums from 1998 and 25 albums from 2018 were included. This yielded 397 tracks from 1998 and 554 tracks from 2018. While the following corpus analysis hopefully is representative of the change in film music now compared to 20 years ago, it only tells us what movies people *paid money for* rather than *watched*, particularly relevant to the 2018 sample, a year in which streaming and pirating movies was a lot more prevalent than in 1998.

## Interesting results

The variable that 1998 soundtracks and 2018 soundtracks seemed to differ the most on was popularity (*M* = 15.5, *SD* = 13.2 in the 1998 sample; *M* = 35.6, *SD* = 20.2). However, this probably does not reflect a difference in music, but rather the fact that Spotify was only launched in 2008.

Besides, it seems that 'energy' was higher in 2018 movie soundtracks (*M* = 0.37, *SD* = 0.26) than in 1998 movie soundtracks (*M* = 0.27, *SD* = 0.22).

Other variables like speechiness, acousticness, liveness, valence, and tempo, did not seem to yield large differences between the years 1998 and 2018, but statistical tests will be necessary to rule out any differences.

Looking at the extreme values, Spotify's results are often in line with common sense. For instance, the most danceable song among 2018 film soundtracks was Another One Bites the Dust (Bohemian Rhapsody), which intuitively seems very danceable due to its rhythm. As another example, the least energetic track in 2018 was Growing Pains (Ralph Breaks the Internet), and its very melancholic and slow sound are in line with both the song title and Spotify's energy rating.

## Outliers

In the 2018 sample, there were two tracks that were only 5 and 6 seconds long: 'Chad Tonight Newscast Bumper' and 'Chad Tonight Talkshow Theme' (Incredibles 2). They probably are jingles from a show within the movie. These not only had the lowest duration among the sample, but also the lowest values for danceability, popularity, liveliness, and valence. Probably, they are too short to be properly analysed by the Spotify algorithms, so I would argue they should be excluded from the sample for further analysis.

Similar, the soundtracks to 'A Star is Born' (2018) and 'Rush Hour' (1998) contain tracks that are dialogue/skits and that should be rejected because they are very short and do not constitute music, and because they yield extreme values on most dimension. I found that Spotify also has a version of the 'A Star is Born' album "without dialogue" with 10 less tracks, so this one should be used for further analysis.
