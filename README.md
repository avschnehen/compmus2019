# Homework Â· Week 6

The corpus contains popular film music from the years 2018 and 1998. More specifically, for each of the two years, 25 of the most commercially successful movies (according to http://boxofficemojo.com/yearly), their music was imported if the complete album was available on Spotify. If the whole album was not available, the film was skipped but all in all, 25 soundtrack albums from 1998 and 25 soundtrack albums from 2018 were included. This yielded 397 songs from 1998 and 554 songs from 2018. While the following corpus analysis hopefully gives an indication about how film music has changed compared to 20 years ago, it does not take into account factors like how people's movie watching behaviour in general may have changed. For instance, pirating and streaming movies was a lot more common in 2018 compared to 1998, so perhaps people in 2018 were more selective about the *types* of movies people went to see in the cinema. One possiblity is that people in 2018 went to the cinema more for action movies with impressive visual effects, and were more likely to pirate drama movies or romantic comedies, which would then appear less in the box office charts (although this is speculative of course).
