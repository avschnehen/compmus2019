# Homework Â· Week 6

The corpus contains popular film music from the years 2018 and 1998. More specifically, for each of the two years, 25 of the most commercially successful movies (according to http://boxofficemojo.com/yearly), their music was imported if the complete album was available on Spotify. If the whole album was not available, the film was skipped but all in all, 25 soundtrack albums from 1998 and 25 soundtrack albums from 2018 were included. This yielded 397 songs from 1998 and 554 songs from 2018. While the following corpus analysis hopefully gives an indication about how film music has changed compared to 20 years ago, it does not take into account factors like how people's movie watching behaviour in general may have changed. For instance, pirating and streaming movies was a lot more common in 2018 compared to 1998, so perhaps people in 2018 were more selective about the *types* of movies people went to see in the cinema. One possiblity is that people in 2018 went to the cinema more for action movies with impressive visual effects, and were more likely to pirate drama movies or romantic comedies, which would then appear less in the box office charts (although this is speculative of course).

## Tracks with extreme values

Most danceable song among 2018 film soundtracks: Another One Bites the Dust (Bohemian Rhapsody) - makes intuitive sense! There are 6 tracks in 2018 with a danceability of 0.0000, of which 3 are very short pieces of dialogue and 2 are very short jingles. The sixth, however, is a 3:03 song where the lack of danceability may stem from rhythmic passages periodically being interrupted by a dramatic dissonant chord.
Least danceable: 

The only two songs with a popularity of 0 are two jingles from a talk show within Incredibles 2, so it makes sense that these 5- and 6-seconds long pieces would not be listened to much. The most popular song was 'Sunflower' (Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse). Their popularity might be explained by them being performed by rappers Post Malone and Swae Lee, who are famous also outside of the movie soundtrack world.

The least energetic song in 2018 is called 'Growing Pains', and the name is fitting: It is very melancholic, slow and indeed could not be described as energetic by any means. The most energetic song is 'Hammer to Fall' (Bohemian Rhapsody), which makes sense too - upon feeling one gets the sense that there is a lot going on.

Interestingly, some of the tracks with a speechiness of 0.0000 are pieces of dialogue, where one would expect very high speechiness. Perhaps this is because they are only few seconds long, hence too short for the Spotify algorithms to work properly. The track with the highest speechiness 'Baba Yaga Lullaby' from Ant-Man in the Wasp, which is a lullaby but is sung intentionally out of tune and towards the end turns into sobbing, so it does sound very much like speech as opposed to song.

The song with the lowest acousticness is 'In Vogue' (Ocean's 8), whose sounds do resemble real instruments (saxophone, flute, organ) but are electronically produced. 'Dumbledore's Theme' (Solo Piano; Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald) has the highest acousticness, which makes sense because it is just played by one solo instrument.

There were more than 50 songs with an instrumentalness of 0. While some of them had instrumental accompiment, it was usually minimal and the voice took centre stage. On the other hand, tracks with the highest instrumentalness were typical orchestral songs with large string sections and flutes.

Lowest scores for liveness were again obtained by the talk show jingles. The highest score is obtained by 'I Love You - Dialogue' (A Star is Born), which is not a piece of music but the protagonists talking, presumably while they are on stage, with lots of audience noise and rhythmic clapping in the background.

Lowest valence were again obtained by dialogue pieces and the talk show jingles, whereas highest valence was obtained by 'Material Girl (200 Du; Crazy Rich Asians), indeed a very cheerful song.

# Outliers

In the 2018 sample, there were two tracks that were only 5 and 6 seconds long: 'Chad Tonight Newscast Bumper' and 'Chad Tonight Talkshow Theme' (Incredibles 2). They probably are jingles from a show within the movie. These not only had the lowest duration among the sample, but also the lowest values for danceability, poularity, liveliness, and valence. Probably, they are too short to be properly analysed by the Spotify algorithms, so I would argue they should be excluded from the sample for further analysis.

Similarly, there are certain tracks on the album to 'A Star is Born' that constitute dialogue and should probably be rejected because they are very short and they are not music. I saw that Spotify also has a version of the album "without dialogue" with 10 tracks less, so this one should be used for further analysis.

In the 1998 sample, there similarly are six very short tracks that only or mostly involve talking (skits) from 'Rush Hour' that yield extreme values on multiple dimensions and should be rejected due to their shortness and the fact that they do not constitute music.
